# Surf Up!
 
## Overview
Our brotha Wavy is out in Hawaii tryna set up a chill spot for people to relax and enjoy the sunshine. He's going to spread vibes by offering surf boards and icecream and hopefully make a living while doing it. We're always there for our brothers, so we are going to use python pandas dataframes to determine the temperatures of Hawaii year round, instead of googling it. This will help our bro decide if he should open up his shop. 


## Results
- June and December are both fair weather temperatures
- The temperature is somewhat higher in June
- The variance in temperature is slightly higher in December


## Summary
 Our boy Wavy should definitely rock this shop. Can't wait to shred some gnar and muck some icecream. Totally!
